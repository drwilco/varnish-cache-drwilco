 * Fields (n, t, l, f, e, d):
 *    n - Name:		Field name, in C-source and stats programs
 *    t - Type:		C-type, uint64_t, unless marked in 'f'
 *    l - Local:	Local counter in worker thread.
 *    f - Format:	Semantics of the value in this field
 *				'a' - Accumulator (deprecated, use 'c')
 *				'b' - Bitmap
 *				'c' - Counter, never decreases.
 *				'g' - Gauge, goes up and down
 *				'i' - Integer (deprecated, use 'g')
 *    e - Explantion:	Short explanation of field (for screen use)
 *    d - Description:	Long explanation of field (for doc use)
 *
 * Please describe Gauge variables as "Number of..." to indicate that
 * this is a snapshot, and Counter variables as "Count of" to indicate
 * accumulative count.
 *
 * -----------------------
 * NB: Cleanup in progress
 * -----------------------
 *
 * Insufficient attention has caused this to become a swamp of conflicting
 * conventions, shorthands and general mumbo-jumbo.  I'm trying to clean
 * it up as I go over the code in other business.
 *
 * Please see the sessmem section for how it should look.
